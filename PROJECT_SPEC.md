# The Great Escape - Project Specification

**Last Updated:** October 28, 2025
**Version:** 1.0 (Phase 1)

---

## üéØ Concept Overview

**The Great Escape** is a Premier League survival pool where players compete to be the last one standing. Each gameweek starts a new pool, and entries continue across multiple gameweeks until eliminated. Players must pick a winning team each week, and once a team is picked, it can't be used again. The last survivor(s) split the pot.

**Tagline Ideas:**
- "Can you pull off the great escape?"
- "Avoid the drop. Win the pot."
- "Every gameweek is a battle for survival."

## üèÜ Core Mechanics

### Pool Structure
- **38 separate pools** (one starts each Premier League gameweek)
- Each pool entry continues across gameweeks until eliminated
- Players compete only against others who entered the same gameweek pool

### Entry & Payment
- **$10 per entry**
- Players can buy multiple entries ($20 = 2 entries, $40 = 4 entries, etc.)
- Each entry is independent and tracks its own team usage
- Payment = immediate eligibility to make picks for that pool

### How It Works (Example)

**Scenario: I buy 2 entries ($20) for Gameweek 5 Pool**

**Entry #1:**
- Gameweek 5: Pick Arsenal (win) ‚úÖ ‚Üí Still alive
- Gameweek 6: Pick Newcastle (win) ‚úÖ ‚Üí Still alive
- Gameweek 7: Pick Man City (draw) ‚ùå ‚Üí ELIMINATED

**Entry #2:**
- Gameweek 5: Pick Arsenal (win) ‚úÖ ‚Üí Still alive
- Gameweek 6: Pick Liverpool (win) ‚úÖ ‚Üí Still alive
- Gameweek 7: Pick Tottenham (win) ‚úÖ ‚Üí Still alive
- Continues...

**Key Points:**
- Both entries can pick the same team in the same gameweek
- Once a team is used by an entry, that specific entry can't use that team again
- Each entry can survive ~20 gameweeks max (20 teams in Premier League)
- Both entries compete in the "Gameweek 5 Pool" against all other Gameweek 5 entries

## üìã Rules & Regulations

### Picking Rules
1. **Must pick a winner** - Draw or loss = elimination
2. **One team per gameweek per entry**
3. **No team reuse** - Once an entry picks a team, that entry can't pick them again
4. **Pick deadline:** 1 hour before the first match of the gameweek kicks off
5. **No pick submitted** = Random team assigned from unused teams for that entry
6. **Cancelled/postponed matches** = Automatic win for anyone who picked that team

### Elimination Rules
- Eliminations processed **1 hour after full-time whistle**
- Draw = Eliminated
- Loss = Eliminated
- Win = Survive to next gameweek

### Payout Rules
- **Last survivor(s) win** - Split pot equally if multiple survivors
- **Platform takes 10%** of total pot
- **If everyone loses in same gameweek** - Refund 90% to all participants (platform keeps 10%)
- **Season end (Gameweek 37)** - All remaining survivors split their pool's pot

### Visibility & Leaderboards
- **Fully public** leaderboards showing all entries and their status
- **Picks become visible** 1 hour before first match (same as deadline)
- **Real-time updates** during matches showing live standings
- Players can see:
  - Who's still alive in their pool
  - What teams everyone picked (after deadline)
  - Live match scores and elimination status

## üí≥ Payment & Legal Considerations

### Stripe Concerns
- This is technically a **sweepstakes/pool betting**
- Stripe Terms prohibit gambling in many jurisdictions
- **Possible workarounds:**
  - Frame as "skill-based fantasy game" (picking winners = skill)
  - Restrict to legal jurisdictions only
  - Alternative: Use crypto payments, Plaid, or specialized gambling processors

### Legal Requirements
- **Age verification** (18+ minimum, 21+ in some US states)
- **Terms of Service** clearly stating rules, odds, no guarantees
- **Responsible gambling messaging**
- **Geo-restrictions** based on local laws
- **Tax reporting** (winnings over certain thresholds)
- Consider consulting with lawyer familiar with online gaming/sweepstakes

### Alternative Payment Options
- **Cryptocurrency** (no payment processor restrictions)
- **Play money** version first (test concept, build audience)
- **Sweepstakes model** (free entry + optional paid entries)
