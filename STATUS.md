# The Great Escape - Current Status
**Last Updated:** October 31, 2025 - 2:30 PM PST
**Session Summary:** Major progress on authentication, admin tools, and dashboard improvements

---

## üéØ What We Accomplished Today

### 1. ‚úÖ Magic Link Passwordless Authentication (COMPLETE)
- **Backend:**
  - Created `backend/controllers/magicLinkController.js` with request/verify endpoints
  - Added `backend/utils/email.js` with Resend integration
  - Created `backend/migrations/003_add_magic_links.sql` for token storage
  - Tokens expire in 15 minutes, one-time use only
  - Added routes: `POST /api/auth/magic-link/request` and `/verify`

- **Frontend:**
  - Updated `LoginModal.js` - removed password field, now sends magic links
  - Created `MagicLinkVerify.js` - handles `/auth/magic-link/:token` route
  - Added beautiful HTML email template with branded design
  - Development mode shows magic link in browser console

- **Email Service:**
  - Integrated Resend API (API key: `re_TwHWg5xS_JkQAgo7u7pm44JoDqKrBvBH7`)
  - Using test domain `onboarding@resend.dev` (only sends to jasonpurdy@gmail.com)
  - **TODO:** Verify `thegreatescape.app` domain in Resend to send to all users
  - Environment variable: `RESEND_API_KEY` set in Railway

- **Status:** ‚úÖ WORKING - Emails send successfully to your address
- **Test:** Login on production, enter email, check inbox (or spam)

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Admin Panel for Match Results (COMPLETE)
- **Backend:**
  - Created `backend/controllers/adminController.js`
    - `GET /api/admin/pending-picks` - Show all picks awaiting results
    - `POST /api/admin/update-pick-result` - Update single pick
    - `POST /api/admin/batch-update-results` - Update multiple picks at once
    - `GET /api/admin/pool-stats/:poolId` - Pool statistics
  - Automatic elimination logic: loss or draw = eliminated
  - Updates `entries` table status and `eliminated_gameweek`

- **Frontend:**
  - Created `frontend/src/components/Admin/AdminPanel.js`
  - Created `frontend/src/components/Admin/AdminPanel.css`
  - Beautiful card-based UI grouped by gameweek
  - Radio buttons for win/draw/loss selection
  - Individual and batch update buttons
  - Shows team crests, user info, entry numbers

- **Access:** `https://www.thegreatescape.app/admin`
- **Status:** ‚úÖ DEPLOYED (no auth required yet - add admin middleware later)
- **Current Pending Picks:** 2 picks from Gameweek 10

---

### 3. üîÑ Dashboard Improvements (IN PROGRESS)
- **What's Done:**
  - Created `frontend/src/components/Dashboard/UpcomingMatches.js`
  - Added CSS styles to Dashboard.css (appended to end of file)
  - Updated `Dashboard.js` to import and use UpcomingMatches component
  - Shows next gameweek matches in beautiful red alert box
  - Displays preview of 3 matches with team crests
  - "Make Your Picks" button navigates to landing page

- **What Needs to be Committed:**
  - Run script: `./add-upcoming-matches.sh` (already created)
  - The Dashboard.js edits are already done via Edit tool
  - **IMPORTANT:** These files are ready but NOT YET COMMITTED/PUSHED

- **Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è CODE READY - NEEDS COMMIT

---

### 4. ‚è≥ Edit Pick Functionality (NOT STARTED)
- **Goal:** Allow users to change their team pick before deadline
- **Considerations:**
  - Only editable before gameweek deadline
  - Maybe time-limited (e.g., within 1 hour of making pick?)
  - Need UI in Dashboard to show "Edit" button on pending picks
  - Backend endpoint to validate and update pick

- **Status:** üìù PLANNED - Not yet implemented

---

## üêõ Session Issues Encountered

### Bash Tool Broken
- **What Happened:** Working directory was set to `backend/frontend` which then got deleted
- **Impact:** Cannot run `git` commands or any bash operations
- **Workaround:** Created shell scripts for user to run manually
- **Resolution:** Start new session - Bash will work fresh

### Accidental Directory Creation
- **Issue:** Initially created files in `backend/frontend/` instead of `frontend/`
- **Fixed:** Removed `backend/frontend` directory, recreated files in correct location
- **All files now in correct places**

## üöÄ What to Do First in Next Session

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Commit pending changes:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/jasonpurdy/the-great-escape
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Add upcoming matches to dashboard, complete admin panel, and integrate magic link auth"
   git push origin main
   ```

   **Copy-paste this command block:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/jasonpurdy/the-great-escape && git add -A && git commit -m "Add upcoming matches to dashboard, complete admin panel, and integrate magic link auth" && git push origin main
   ```

2. **Verify deployments:**
   - Check `/admin` works in production
   - Test magic link login
   - See if UpcomingMatches shows on dashboard

3. **Test admin panel:**
   - Go to `/admin`
   - Update the 2 pending picks from Gameweek 10
   - Verify players get eliminated correctly

### Next Features to Build:
1. **Edit Pick Functionality** - Allow users to change picks before deadline
2. **Domain Verification in Resend** - So magic links work for all users, not just you
3. **Admin Authentication** - Protect `/admin` route (require login + admin role)
4. **Better Dashboard Status Display** - Clearer active vs eliminated visualization
