### **Phase 4: PayPal/Braintree Integration (Week 3)**

**PREREQUISITE:** PayPal merchant approval must be submitted during this phase. Integration can be built in sandbox mode while waiting for approval.

#### 4A: Braintree Setup

1. Create Braintree sandbox account
2. Get API credentials (Merchant ID, Public Key, Private Key)
3. Configure Braintree gateway in backend
4. Test sandbox transactions

**Files:**
- `backend/config/braintree.js` - Braintree configuration
- `backend/services/paymentService.js` - Payment processing logic

#### 4B: Entry Purchase Flow

**Backend API Endpoints:**
```
POST /api/payments/client-token
Response: { clientToken: "..." } // For Braintree Drop-in UI

POST /api/payments/purchase-entry
Body: {
  poolId: 1,
  numberOfEntries: 2, // $20 for 2 entries
  paymentMethodNonce: "..." // From Braintree frontend
}
Response: {
  success: true,
  entries: [{id: 1, entryNumber: 1}, {id: 2, entryNumber: 2}],
  transaction: {...}
}
```

**Payment Flow:**
1. User selects pool and number of entries
2. Frontend requests client token from backend
3. Braintree Drop-in UI loads (handles payment method collection)
4. User enters payment info (card, PayPal, Venmo)
5. Braintree tokenizes payment ‚Üí returns nonce
6. Frontend sends nonce to backend
7. Backend creates Braintree transaction
8. If successful: Create entries, record transaction, update pool totals
9. Return success + entry details

**Files:**

---

### **Phase 5: Payout System (Week 4)**

1. Query all active entries for a pool
2. Check if any entries have zero losses/draws
3. If survivors exist ‚Üí mark as winners
4. If no survivors (everyone eliminated same gameweek) ‚Üí refund scenario
5. Calculate payout amounts (90% of pot split among winners)

**Files:**
- `backend/services/poolService.js` - Pool management logic
- `backend/jobs/processResults.js` - Automated result processing (cron job)

#### 5B: PayPal Payouts API Integration

**Backend API Endpoints:**

Response: { payouts: [...], totalPaid: 90000 }

GET /api/users/me/payouts
Response: { payouts: [{amount: 90000, status: "completed", ...}] }

POST /api/users/me/withdraw
Body: { amountCents: 50000, paypalEmail: "user@example.com" }
Response: { success: true, payoutId: "..." }
```

**PayPal Payouts Flow:**
1. Winner determined (entry status = 'winner')
2. Create payout record in database
3. Call PayPal Payouts API to send money
4. Update payout status (processing ‚Üí completed/failed)
5. Create transaction record
6. Update user account balance (if using balance system)
7. Send email notification to winner

- `backend/routes/payouts.js` - Payout routes (admin + user)
- `backend/jobs/processPayouts.js` - Automated payout processing

#### 5C: Refund Scenario

If everyone in a pool is eliminated the same gameweek:
1. Calculate refund amount (90% of entry fee per entry)
2. Refund via original payment method (Braintree API)
3. Platform keeps 10%
4. Update entry status to 'refunded'
5. Send refund confirmation email

**Files:**
- `backend/services/refundService.js` - Refund logic

#### 5D: Tax Reporting (1099 Forms)

For winners receiving $600+ in a calendar year:
- Track total payouts per user per year
- Generate 1099-MISC forms (future integration with tax service)
- Collect SSN/TIN from users (when needed)
- Store tax documents securely

**Files:**

- User management (view, ban, verify)
- Pool management (view entries, manually trigger payouts)
- Transaction monitoring
- Fraud detection alerts
- Manual payout processing

#### Acceptance Criteria:

## ‚ùì Questions to Clarify Before Coding

**Hey Jason!** Before I start building, let me ask a few questions to make sure I build exactly what you want:

1. **Account Balance vs Direct Payout:**
   - Option A: Winnings go to user's account balance, they request withdrawal
   - Option B: Winnings paid directly to PayPal immediately
   - **Which do you prefer?**

2. **Payment Methods:**
   - Braintree supports: Credit cards, PayPal, Venmo, Apple Pay, Google Pay
   - **Do you want all of these, or start with just cards + PayPal?**

3. **Database Hosting:**
   - Railway (easy), AWS RDS (more control), Heroku (simple)
   - **Where do you want to host the PostgreSQL database?**

4. **Email Service:**
   - For sending registration confirmations, payout notifications, etc.
   - Options: SendGrid, AWS SES, Postmark
   - **Which email service? Or should I stub it for now?**

5. **Admin Access:**
   - Create a special admin user manually? Or build admin registration?
   - **How do you want admin accounts created?**

6. **Multiple Entries UX:**
   - When buying 3 entries, should user name them? ("Arsenal Strategy", "Safe Picks", etc.)
   - Or just "Entry #1", "Entry #2", "Entry #3"?
   - **What's better for users?**

Let me know your preferences and I'll start building! üöÄ
