## 💰 Payment Flow Design

### The Balance System (Your Genius Idea!)

**User Balance = Winnings + Referral Credits + Deposits**

### Flow 1: New User Pays with PayPal
```
1. User picks team (Arsenal)
2. Clicks "Lock in pick"
3. Signs up (email, password, etc.)
4. Chooses "Pay with PayPal" ($10)
5. PayPal checkout → Payment captured
6. Backend:
   a. Add $10 to user balance
   b. Record deposit transaction
   c. Deduct $10 from balance for entry
   d. Record entry purchase transaction
   e. Create entry + lock pick
   f. Update pool totals
7. User sees: "Pick locked! Good luck!"
```

### Flow 2: Existing User with Balance
```
1. User picks team (Liverpool)
2. Clicks "Lock in pick"
3. Sees: "Your balance: $50.00"
4. Chooses "Use Account Balance"
5. Backend:
   a. Verify balance >= $10
   b. Deduct $10 from balance
   c. Create entry + lock pick
   d. Record transaction
   e. Update pool totals
6. User sees: "Pick locked! New balance: $40.00"
```

### Why This System is Perfect
✅ Winners keep playing (balance grows)
✅ Referral credits = free entries (viral growth)
✅ Clean accounting (every dollar movement tracked)
✅ Feels like "house money" (lower psychological barrier)
✅ Users can withdraw anytime (trust + flexibility)

## 🎯 The Flywheel Effect

Your payment system creates a viral growth loop:

```
New User ($10 PayPal)
    ↓
Balance = $10
    ↓
Entry purchased → Balance = $0
    ↓
User refers 3 friends → Balance = $30 (3 × $10 referral credits)
    ↓
3 free entries → Still engaged, no risk
    ↓
Wins $90 → Balance = $90
    ↓
Uses $10 from balance → Balance = $80
    ↓
Stays engaged (playing with "house money")
    ↓
Refers more friends...
```

**Key Insight:** Balance system keeps users in the ecosystem. Winners don't cash out immediately - they keep playing!

## 💡 Pro Tips for Frontend

**Pick-First UX:**
1. Store selected team in localStorage
2. Show "Lock in Arsenal?" confirmation
3. Modal: "Create account to lock in your pick"
4. Seamless signup → payment → pick locked
5. They're committed before ever entering payment info

**Payment UI:**
```jsx
{balance > 0 ? (
  <>
    <RadioButton>Use Balance (${balance})</RadioButton>
    <RadioButton>Pay with PayPal ($10)</RadioButton>
  </>
) : (
  <PayPalButton amount={10} />
)}
```

**Referral Section (Make it BIG!):**
```jsx
<ReferralCard>
  🎁 Invite a Friend
  You both get a FREE PICK ($10 value)!

  Your code: JASON2025
  [Copy Link] [Share on Twitter] [Share on WhatsApp]

  Friends referred: 12 ($120 earned!)
</ReferralCard>
```
